# 👋 Hey, I'm Mauricio Emilio Monroy González

I am passionate about technological change and want to be part of the digital transformation to help create a better and more sustainable world through technology and innovation. To achieve this, I will graduate in a few years as a Computer Technologies Engineer, developing the skills and tools needed to be part of this change.  
I see myself as a structured person with agile, critical, numerical, analytical, and focused thinking, committed to strong results orientation, adaptable, and goal-driven.  
I believe in teamwork, participating both as a leader and executing complex plans by dynamically organizing activities and people.  
I always strive to be guided by values such as integrity, honesty, passion, dedication, and love for work, family, and my loved ones.
